            <h3>Season 1, Episode 1</h3>
            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p>In the pilot episode of Community, we are introduced to the disparate group of misfits who find themselves at Greendale Community College for wildly different reasons. Central to the group is Jeff Winger, a disbarred lawyer forced to return to college when his degree is invalidated. Hoping to coast through as easily as possible, Jeff attempts to form a study group solely to get closer to a fellow student, Britta Perry. However, his plan backfires when the group expands to include a diverse mix of individuals: Abed Nadir, an eccentric film buff; Shirley Bennett, a recently divorced mother; Troy Barnes, a former high school football star; Annie Edison, a young overachiever; and Pierce Hawthorne, an aging, inappropriate businessman. The episode sets the stage for a series that is as much about unexpected friendships as it is about comedic antics, all while poking fun at traditional sitcom tropes and the very concept of community college itself.</p>

                <li>Danny Pudi is half-Polish and 1/16th Filipino, as he himself stated for a Community promotional ad that aired on Fox Philippines.</li>
                <li>The pilot marks the first time Abed utters, "Cool. Cool cool cool." He says this while writing on the sign-up sheet for the "study group".</li>
                <li>When Abed mentions that it feels like "Stripes", this is a reference to the name of Joel McHale's character on the show, Jeff Winger. Bill Murray's character was named John Winger and was the inspiration for Dan Harmon to name the character.</li>
                <li>The 88's cover of "Don't You (Forget About Me)", which plays at the end of the episode, is a reference to "The Breakfast Club" (1985), which uses the original version of the song by Simple Minds at its ending. This is because of Abed likening his life to the movie throughout the episode.</li>
