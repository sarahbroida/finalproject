            <h3>Season 1, Episode 1</h3>
            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p>In the first episode of Community, we get to know a seemingly random group of people, all taking Spanish 101 at Greendale Community College. We begin with Jeff Winger, a former lawyer who practiced for seven years before getting found out that he never received a bachelor’s degree. He eyes Britta Perry, an activist, in class, and fabricates a Spanish study group as a way to try to get a date. Unfortunately for him, she sees right through his ploy and invites Abed Nadir, a socially awkward and film-focused college kid, to join their first session. He invites others from the class - Annie Edison, a naive perfectionist; Troy Barnes, a former football jock; Shirley Bennet, a recently divorced mother of two, and Pierce Hawthorne, a brusque, rude elder. Now that Jeff has a handful of eager students on his hands, he has to figure out a way to navigate the study session while still trying to woo Britta. This first episode sets the stage for an average sitcom that quickly turns into a self-aware, smart, and topsy-turvy show everyone would love.</p>

                <li>One of the fan-favorite episodes delves into the world of parallel timelines, when Jeff rolls a dice to see who should go downstairs to receive the pizza delivery. Some timelines turn out better than others!</li>
                <li>The paintball-themed episodes are some of the most popular, as they transform the sitcom world into an action-packed, spoof-filled escapade. Each paintball episode has a different inspiration, including Old West, Star Wars, Dystopian, and Secret Agent. The fun of these episodes is palpable and it is jam-packed with laughs.</li>
                <li>The end-credit scenes are often with just Troy and Abed, but also feature the other main characters and some side characters. They also often feature the guest star on the episode, such as Betty White.</li>
                <li>The Community movie is rumored to be in production, but between the recent strikes and the show’s unstable history of cancellations and reboots, as well as cast rifts, it is unclear whether it will last.</li>
