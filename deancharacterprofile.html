            <h3>Character Breakdown</h3>
            <h2>Dean Pelton</h2>
            <p>Dean Craig Pelton , played by Jim Rash, is the eccentric, odd, high-energy dean of Greendale Community college. He begins as a minor character around the school, but as the seasons pass, becomes one of the star characters. One of his most memorable qualities are his outfits, which are often over-the-top, highly on theme, and “to the nines”. He uses them to declare pun-filled announcements and give news to “Jeff and the study group”. His relationship with Jeff Winger, although one-sided, is heartfelt, and he carries a lot of passion and loyalty for the school. He’s an odd bird, maybe, who makes his fair share of mistakes, but like everyone at Greendale, his quirks are easily lovable and highly entertaining.</p>

            <ul class="Facts">
                <li>The Dean throws many dances a year at Greendale, sometimes even more than a high school.</li>
                <li>The Dean’s flamboyant outfits are some of the most memorable and popular parts of the show, as well as some of his key dialogue. He quickly became a fan favorite as the seasons progressed.</li>
                <li>At one point, the Dean reveals he’s worked at many schools over the years, and all of them have shut down. This is more understandable as the seasons progress and a consultant is eventually hired, who sees just how the downfall’s of the schools might’ve happened. While well-meaning, the Dean is not the best decision maker.</li>
                <li>Out of all of the main characters, the Dean is the biggest fan of Jeff, who does not return his advances. He can often be seen touching Jeff’s shoulder, pointing him out by name, and acting flirtatiously toward him. Although Jeff does not reciprocate, he is insistent and the group loves him despite his eccentric nature towards Jeff.</li>
