            <h3>Character Breakdown</h3>
            <h2>Dean Pelton</h2>
            <p>Dean Craig Pelton is the flamboyantly eccentric and endlessly enthusiastic administrator of Greendale Community College. Played with delightful zeal by Jim Rash, Dean Pelton is known for his outlandish costumes and penchant for making grand, often awkward, announcements over the school's PA system. His deep affection for the institution and its students often leads him into bizarre and hilariously inappropriate scenarios, particularly in his interactions with Jeff Winger and the rest of the study group. Despite his sometimes questionable methods and frequent overstepping of boundaries, Dean Pelton's heart is always in the right place, making him a beloved and uniquely memorable character in the Community universe.</p>
